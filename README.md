# Maps4DAPS
#### We work on the philosophy of “by the people, for the people.” Instead of relying on critics and randos on the internet, Maps4DAPS gives you the freedom to rate locations on their accessibility for your specific disability.

#### Maps4DAPS is a web-based platform designed to help individuals with disabilities find and rate locations based on accessibility. Our mission is to provide a more inclusive and informed experience for disabled users when navigating public spaces and amenities.
